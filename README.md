# Verify My Age

This project aims to meticulously recreate the interface originally designed in Figma, showcasing the capabilities of form handling, state management, and fundamental unit testing within a React-based framework. Developed entirely from the ground up without reliance on external libraries, this includes basic unit testing for select components to ensure robustness and reliability. Additionally, the project incorporates an API for DDI listing, enhancing its functionality. It is built using the latest version of Next.js, 14.1.0, to leverage the most current features and optimizations available in the framework.
